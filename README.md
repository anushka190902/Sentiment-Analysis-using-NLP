# Emotion Detection in Social Media Comments Using NLP

## Overview

This project focuses on **emotion detection in social media comments** by leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The goal is to identify emotions such as happiness, anger, sadness, and surprise in user-generated text, enabling better understanding of sentiment trends and enhancing applications like content moderation and user engagement analysis.

## Key Objectives

- Preprocess social media comments to make them suitable for emotion detection.
- Build and train NLP models to classify emotions effectively.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Provide actionable insights through analysis and visualization.

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Utilized public datasets or scraped data containing labeled social media comments.
   - Classes included emotions like joy, anger, sadness, fear, and neutral.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization, lowercasing, and stop-word removal.
   - Removal of URLs, mentions, hashtags, and special characters.
   - Stemming and lemmatization for text normalization.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracted features using methods like Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and word embeddings (e.g., GloVe, Word2Vec).
   - Applied advanced embeddings using pre-trained transformer models like BERT.

4. **Model Building**:
   - Experimented with classification models:
     - Traditional: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM
     - Deep Learning: LSTMs, GRUs, and transformers (BERT)
   - Fine-tuned models to improve accuracy and generalization.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for performance evaluation.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Created word clouds, emotion distribution graphs, and confusion matrices for insights.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - **NLP**: NLTK, SpaCy, Hugging Face Transformers
  - **Modeling**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
  - **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Pre-trained Models**: GloVe, Word2Vec, BERT
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

## Key Highlights

- Achieved a high F1-score on the test dataset, indicating the model's ability to classify emotions effectively.
- Experimented with various feature extraction methods and neural network architectures to optimize performance.
- Developed a streamlined and reusable pipeline for emotion detection in textual data.

## Potential Applications

- **Content Moderation**: Automatically detect harmful or sensitive comments.
- **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Understand customer emotions for better service.
- **Social Media Monitoring**: Track emotional trends and public sentiment.
- **Mental Health Analysis**: Identify distress signals in user comments.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of NLP in understanding human emotions through text analysis. The methodology and insights can be extended to various domains like customer service, mental health, and social media analysis.
